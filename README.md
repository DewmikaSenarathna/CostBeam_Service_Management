# CostBeam

**CostBeam** is a personal collaborative project built to modernize construction management by bridging **Civil Engineering insights** with **Computer Engineering innovation**.  
This platform provides construction companies with a smarter way to track costs, monitor profits, and manage site inventory ‚Äî helping them move beyond traditional manual record-keeping.

## üöÄ Project Overview
During our observations of the civil construction field, we noticed many companies still rely on manual methods for expense tracking, profit-loss calculations, and inventory management. These methods are often:
- Time-consuming  
- Prone to errors  
- Difficult to analyze for decision-making  

To solve this, we created **CostBeam** ‚Äî a digital platform that brings automation, accuracy, and user-friendly design to construction management.

## üë• Collaboration
This project represents the **unity of two fields**:  
- **Civil Engineering (Sadish)** ‚Äì Provided domain expertise, identified practical problems in construction workflows, and guided real-world solution design.  
- **Computer Engineering (Dewmika Senarathna)** ‚Äì Designed, built, and implemented the web application using **PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with a **dark-themed, colorful, responsive, and user-friendly interface**.

Together, we transformed ideas into a real-world solution, showing how interdisciplinary collaboration can lead to innovation.
